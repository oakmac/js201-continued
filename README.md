# JavaScript 201 Continued - More Programming Exercises

This repo contains programming exercises designed for someone who is new to
programming. The exercises here are a continuation of the exercises found in
[js201].

These exercises use Strings, loops, Objects, Arrays, and Functions to solve
logic problems.

## Install

Make sure that [Node.js] and [npm] are installed. Then, from this directory type:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install a folder named `node_modules/` into this folder.

## Directions

You will be writing functions in the JavaScript files found in the `exercises/`
folder.

Write your functions and then run:

```sh
npm test
```

The goal is to get the test suite to pass all conditions. Good luck!

## Continuously Run Test Suite

You may want to run the test suite anytime a file in `exercises/` changes:

```sh
npm run watch
```

This command will continuously run the test suite and stop on the first failing
test.
